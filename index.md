## Welcome to GitHub Pages
[start](https://github.com/xammurapi/-/blob/main/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B9.html)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/xammurapi/-/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/xammurapi/-/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
